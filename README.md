# cirkuitz
A modern circuit diagram editor.

Cirkuitz is a modern, graphical editor for circuit diagrams, capable of rendering high-quality diagrams for screen viewing, and exporting to LaTeX via circuitikz.

Creating and modifying diagrams with cirkuitz is orders of magnitude faster than writing the equivalent LaTeX by hand and, with a little experience, competes with pen-and-paper.
Cirkuitz was inspired by [varkor/quiver](https://github.com/varkor/quiver) and is an experiment in coding with AI.
